                <br><td>Persian cats are renowned for being docile, kind, and gentle. Despite the fact that they are very affectionate cats, they can be selective in who they pay attention to.</td> 
                    <td>Maine Coons are not only enormous in size, but also enormous in personality. They are renowned for being amiable, affectionate, and silly. Like a dog, the Maine Coon enjoys spending time with its family and occasionally exhibits pack behavior. They will respond when called and are obedient.</td>
                    <td>Siamese cats have long, lean frames and muscular, slim bodies. He is easily recognized due to his long, thin tail and limbs as well as a colorpoint pattern with strong contrast. His colorpoint coats appear mysterious because of the darkened masquerade-like fur that is located close to the face, ears, legs, and tail.</td>
                    <td>A British Shorthair Cat makes a wonderful pet and companion. She is calm and laid-back. The British cat is a fiercely devoted, adoring creature who will cling to every member of her family. Although the British enjoys playing, she doesn't require round-the-clock care.</td>
                    <td>The independent American Shorthair Cat dislikes being carried around. She might occasionally curl up in your lap, but she might also choose to sit next to you.</td>
