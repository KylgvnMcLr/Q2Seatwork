	<p>The pet I chose is my cat named Copper The Cat, the reason why his name is Copper because his hair color is copper so we decided to name him copper, he is a naughty cat he likes to open doors, windows, and he escaped alot of times from our house because he likes opening things. Copper is 2 years old and his breed is Persian Cat</p>
